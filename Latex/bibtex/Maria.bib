abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of prescribing errors identified by pharmacists in hospital inpatients and the factors influencing error identification rates by pharmacists throughout hospital admission. SETTING: 880-bed university teaching hospital in North-west England. METHODS: Data about prescribing errors identified by pharmacists (median: 9 (range 4-17) collecting data per day) when conducting routine work were prospectively recorded on 38 randomly selected days over 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of new medication orders in which an error was identified; predictors of error identification rate, adjusted for workload and seniority of pharmacist, day of week, type of ward or stage of patient admission. RESULTS: 33,012 new medication orders were reviewed for 5,199 patients; 3,455 errors (in 10.5{\%} of orders) were identified for 2,040 patients (39.2{\%}; median 1, range 1-12). Most were problem orders (1,456, 42.1{\%}) or potentially significant errors (1,748, 50.6{\%}); 197 (5.7{\%}) were potentially serious; 1.6{\%} (n = 54) were potentially severe or fatal. Errors were 41{\%} (CI: 28-56{\%}) more likely to be identified at patient's admission than at other times, independent of confounders. Workload was the strongest predictor of error identification rates, with 40{\%} (33-46{\%}) less errors identified on the busiest days than at other times. Errors identified fell by 1.9{\%} (1.5-2.3{\%}) for every additional chart checked, independent of confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists routinely identify errors but increasing workload may reduce identification rates. Where resources are limited, they may be better spent on identifying and addressing errors immediately after admission to hospital.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency, type, and consequences of medication errors in more stages of the medication process, including discharge summaries. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using three methods to detect errors in the medication process: direct observations, unannounced control visits, and chart reviews. With the exception of errors in discharge summaries all potential medication error consequences were evaluated by physicians and pharmacists. SETTING: A randomly selected medical and surgical department at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Eligible in-hospital patients aged 18 or over (n = 64), physicians prescribing drugs and nurses dispensing and administering drugs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency, type, and potential clinical consequences of all detected errors compared with the total number of opportunities for error. RESULTS: We detected a total of 1065 errors in 2467 opportunities for errors (43{\%}). In worst case scenario 20-30{\%} of all evaluated medication errors were assessed as potential adverse drug events. In each stage the frequency of medication errors were-ordering: 167/433 (39{\%}), transcription: 310/558 (56{\%}), dispensing: 22/538 (4{\%}), administration: 166/412 (41{\%}), and finally discharge summaries: 401/526 (76{\%}). The most common types of error throughout the medication process were: lack of drug form, unordered drug, omission of drug/dose, and lack of identity control. CONCLUSION: There is a need for quality improvement, as almost 50{\%} of all errors in doses and prescriptions in the medication process were caused by missing actions. We assume that the number of errors could be reduced by simple changes of existing procedures or by implementing automated technologies in the medication process.},

@article{Hakonsen2010,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Efforts to restrain pharmaceutical costs in the Norwegian hospital sector have focused on putting pharmaceuticals out to tender with resultant frequent changes in medicine inventories. Due to the extent of physicians failing to prescribe from the hospital drug list, the nurses have to perform generic substitution on the wards. The objective of the present study is to investigate the hospital nurses' experiences with generic substitution and to explore their views on this strategy as a risk factor for medication errors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Personal interviews with 100 nurses who were employed in a large Norwegian hospital were conducted using a semistructured questionnaire.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In all, 75{\%} of nurses thought it was problematic that the hospital's drug inventory was subject to frequent changes, and 91{\%} believed that the high number of generic products may contribute to erroneous dispensing. Nevertheless, three out of four admitted that they seldom or never verified the feasibility of the substitution with the physician, and that it was seldom documented in the medical charts. In total, 42{\%} of the nurses had experienced mistakes that occurred as a result of substitution. They claimed that the medication errors relating to generic substitution derived from difficult drug names, frequent changes in the drug inventory, and the increasing number of generic drugs, as well as from heavy workload and insufficient training.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that generic substitution is often carried out by nurses on the wards. The nurses feel insecure about the situation and report that they do not have the necessary training for the task. They clearly believe that a high number of generic drugs and frequent generic substitutions are risk factors for medication errors. Hence, hospital managers should be aware that such strategies to reduce costs may interfere with patient safety.},
