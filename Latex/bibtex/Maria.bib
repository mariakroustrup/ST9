abstract = {A very large part of India's population fulfils its healthcare needs from government run healthcare delivery system which is free, contributory or highly subsidised. Use of medicines forms a large part of healthcare facility. As the number of medicines and brands are ever increasing in today's market, it is usual for pharmacy to substitute a generic instead of the prescribed brand or a different brand if the prescribed brand is not available. Depending on the type of substitute, it could fall under 'generic' or 'therapeutic' substitution. For any condition, there may be numerous medicines existing, some of which probably got introduced more recently, may be more expensive and erroneously perceived to act better than the earlier known medications for the same ailment. Also, due to very high number of medicines that are approved and available for use in the market, it is impossible to stock all the medicines in any pharmacy. Generic and therapeutic substitutions should be formalised and implemented by institutions, with the consent and cooperation of all the stake holders as guided by World Health Organisation. The advantages and limitations of medicine substitutes are discussed in the review.},

abstract = {Medication error is an important cause of patient morbidity and mortality, yet it can be a confusing and underappreciated concept. This article provides a review for practicing physicians that focuses on medication error (1) terminology and definitions, (2) incidence, (3) risk factors, (4) avoidance strategies, and (5) disclosure and legal consequences. A medication error is any error that occurs at any point in the medication use process. It has been estimated by the Institute of Medicine that medication errors cause 1 of 131 outpatient and 1 of 854 inpatient deaths. Medication factors (eg, similar sounding names, low therapeutic index), patient factors (eg, poor renal or hepatic function, impaired cognition, polypharmacy), and health care professional factors (eg, use of abbreviations in prescriptions and other communications, cognitive biases) can precipitate medication errors. Consequences faced by physicians after medication errors can include loss of patient trust, civil actions, criminal charges, and medical board discipline. Methods to prevent medication errors from occurring (eg, use of information technology, better drug labeling, and medication reconciliation) have been used with varying success. When an error is discovered, patients expect disclosure that is timely, given in person, and accompanied with an apology and communication of efforts to prevent future errors. Learning more about medication errors may enhance health care professionals' ability to provide safe care to their patients. {\textcopyright} 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.},

abstract = {To develop a simple, valid model to identify patients at high risk of opioid overdose-related hospitalization and mortality, Oregon prescription drug monitoring program, Vital Records, and Hospital Discharge data were linked to estimate 2 logistic models; a first model that included a broad range of risk factors from the literature and a second simplified model. Receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, and specificity of the models were analyzed. Variables retained in the final model were categories such as older than 35 years, number of prescribers, number of pharmacies, and prescriptions for long-acting opioids, benzodiazepines or sedatives, or carisoprodol. The ability of the model to discriminate between patients who did and did not overdose was reasonably good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.82, Nagelkerke R = 0.11). The positive predictive value of the model was low. Computationally simple models can identify high-risk patients based on prescription history alone, but improvement of the predictive value of models may require information from outside the prescription drug monitoring program. Patient or prescription features that predict opioid overdose may differ from those that predict diversion.},

abstract = {Risk factors play a central part in prediction and prevention. A critical issue in any discussion of risk factors is to ensure that the term risk factor, and associated terms such as correlate and marker, are defined in a precise, consistent manner.1 The starting point is to understand that a correlate is a variable that is associated, either positively or negatively, with an outcome. The presence or absence of a correlate can be measured in each subject. The term subject need not be an individual but could be a family, classroom, school, or an entire community. The outcomes can be dimensional, but they are restricted in this discussion to binary ones. Binary outcomes are the most relevant in medical practice. The physician and patient are concerned about whether the patient has or does not have the illness or disorder. The correlate can be measured at the same time as the outcome and thus be a concomitant of it, or it can be measured after the outcome and be a consequence or result of it. A risk factor can be considered a type of correlate. It is associated with an increased probability of an outcome, usually an unpleasant one. It has, however, a major distinguishing characteristic from other correlates, which is it occurs before the outcome. This is 1 of the 2 defining characteristics of a risk factor. The measure of the risk factor is taken on each subject before the subject has the outcome of interest. The second defining characteristic of a risk factor is that it can be used to divide a population into high risk and low risk subgroups. The probability of the outcome must be shown to be greater in the high risk compared with the low risk group. Thus, the 2 defining characteristics of a {\ldots}},

Perhaps it is because decision making is such a commonplace activity that it is assumed we can all make effective decisions. However, this is not the case and the example of diagnostic error supports this assertion. Until quite recently there has been a general nihilism about the ability to change the way that we think, but it is now becoming accepted that if we can think about, and understand, our thinking processes we can improve our decision making, including diagnosis. In this paper we review the dual process model of decision making and highlight ways in which decision making can be improved through the application of this model to our day-to-day practice and by the adoption of de-biasing strategies and critical thinking.},

abstract = {This paper describes a prototype clinical decision support system (CDSS) for risk stratification of patients with cardiac chest pain. A newly developed belief rule-based inference methodology-RIMER was employed for developing the prototype. Based on the belief rule-based inference methodology, the prototype CDSS can deal with uncertainties in both clinical domain knowledge and clinical data. Moreover, the prototype can automatically update its knowledge base via a belief rule base (BRB) learning module which can adjust BRB through accumulated historical clinical cases. The domain specific knowledge used to construct the knowledge base of the prototype was learned from real patient data. We simulated a set of 1000 patients in cardiac chest pain to validate the prototype. The belief rule-based prototype CDSS has been found to perform extremely well. Firstly, the system can provide more reliable and informative diagnosis recommendations than manual diagnosis using traditional rules when there are clinical uncertainties. Secondly, the diagnostic performance of the system can be significantly improved after training the BRB through accumulated clinical cases. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {From the very earliest moments in the modern history of the computer, scientists have dreamed of creating an " electronic brain " . Of all the modern technological quests, this search to create artificially intelligent (AI) computer systems has been one of the most ambitious and, not surprisingly, controversial. It also seems that very early on, scientists and doctors alike were captivated by the potential such a technology might have in medicine (e.g. Ledley and Lusted, 1959). With intelligent computers able to store and process vast stores of knowledge, the hope was that they would become perfect 'doctors in a box', assisting or surpassing clinicians with tasks like diagnosis. With such motivations, a small but talented community of computer scientists and healthcare professionals set about shaping a research program for a new discipline called Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM). These researchers had a bold vision of the way AIM would revolutionise medicine, and push forward the frontiers of technology. AI in medicine at that time was a largely US-based research community. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Optimal decisions about the use of antibiotics and other antiinfective agents in critically ill patients require access to a large amount of complex information. We have developed a computerized decision-support program linked to computer-based patient records that can assist physicians in the use of antiinfective agents and improve the quality of care. This program presents epidemiologic information, along with detailed recommendations and warnings. The program recommends antiinfective regimens and courses of therapy for particular patients and provides immediate feedback. We prospectively studied the use of the computerized antiinfectives-management program for one year in a 12-bed intensive care unit. RESULTS: During the intervention period, all 545 patients admitted were cared for with the aid of the antiinfectives-management program. Measures of processes and outcomes were compared with those for the 1136 patients admitted to the same unit during the two years before the intervention period. The use of the program led to significant reductions in orders for drugs to which the patients had reported allergies (35, vs. 146 during the preintervention period; P{\textless}0.01), excess drug dosages (87 vs. 405, P{\textless}0.01), and antibiotic-susceptibility mismatches (12 vs. 206, P{\textless}0.01). There were also marked reductions in the mean number of days of excessive drug dosage (2.7 vs. 5.9, P{\textless}0.002) and in adverse events caused by antiinfective agents (4 vs. 28, P{\textless}0.02). In analyses of patients who received antiinfective agents, those treated during the intervention period who always received the regimens recommended by the computer program (n=203) had significant reductions, as compared with those who did not always receive the recommended regimens (n= 195) and those in the preintervention cohort (n = 766), in the cost of antiinfective agents (adjusted mean, {\$}102 vs. {\$}427 and {\$}340, respectively; P{\textless}0.001), in total hospital costs (adjusted mean, {\$}26,315 vs. {\$}44,865 and {\$}35,283; P{\textless}0.001), and in the length of the hospital stay days (adjusted mean, 10.0 vs. 16.7 and 12.9; P{\textless}0.001).

abstract = {To address the recognized problems associated with information overload and limited human memory, computer based systems which help healthcare providers use information to make better decisions have been developed and implemented. These decision aids are designed to improve the quality and reduce the cost of healthcare. Currently, the most widely used computer application is to simply provide needed facts about the patient in an organized and timely fashion. Additionally, healthcare workers can access literature, ask questions of aggregates of patient data for clinical or administrative decisions, receive warnings or suggestions when the patient's data satisfy certain logical rules, receive critiques when proposing therapies or ordering diagnostic tests, receive guidelines for standards of care, access programs which analyze tradeoffs and likelihoods of alternative outcomes (decision analysis) and receive lists of differential diagnoses. Given this wonderful panoply of capabilities, the question becomes 'why aren't more people using these aids and what are the demonstrated benefits of such capabilities?' In this paper we review the types of decision aids which have been successfully implemented and the challenges to implementation (knowledge representation, connections to databases, need for comprehensive, coded databases and evaluation of benefits).},

abstract = {Background: The annual cost of morbidity and mortality due to medication errors in the U.S. has been estimated at {\$}76.6 billion. Information technology implemented systematically has the potential to significantly reduce medication errors that result in adverse drug events (ADEs). Objective: To develop a computer simulation model that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of information technology applications designed to detect and prevent medication errors that result in adverse drug effects. Methods: A computer simulation model Was constructed representing the medication delivery system in a hospital. STELLA, a continuous simulation software package, was used to construct the model. Parameters of the model were estimated from a study of prescription errors on two hospital medical/surgical units and used in the baseline simulation. Five prevention strategies were simulated based on information obtained from the literature. Results: The model simulates the four stages of the medication delivery system: prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, and administering drugs. We simulated interventions that have been demonstrated in prior studies to decrease error rates. The results suggest that an integrated medication delivery system can save up to 1,226 days of excess hospitalization and {\$}1.4 million in associated costs annually in a large hospital. The results of the analyses regarding the effects of the interventions on the additional hospital costs associated with ADEs are somewhat sensitive to the distribution of errors in the hospital, more sensitive to the costs of an ADE, and most sensitive to the proportion of medication errors resulting in ADEs. Conclusions: The results suggest that clinical information systems are potentially a cost-effective means of preventing ADEs in hospitals and demonstrate the importance of viewing medication errors from a systems perspective. Prevention efforts that focus on a single stage of the process had limited impact on the overall error rate. This study suggests that system-wide changes to the medication delivery system are required to drastically reduce mediation errors that may result in ADEs in a hospital setting.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of generic substitution decision support on electronic (e-) prescribing of generic medications.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: The authors analyzed retrospective outpatient e-prescribing data from an academic medical center and affiliated network for July 1, 2005-September 30, 2008 using an interrupted time-series design to assess the rate of generic prescribing before and after implementing generic substitution decision support. To assess background secular trends, e-prescribing was compared with a concurrent random sample of hand-generated prescriptions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS: Proportion of generic medications prescribed before and after the intervention, evaluated over time, and compared with a sample of prescriptions generated without e-prescribing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The proportion of generic medication prescriptions increased from 32.1{\%} to 54.2{\%} after the intervention (22.1{\%} increase, 95{\%} CI 21.9{\%} to 22.3{\%}), with no diminution in magnitude of improvement post-intervention. In the concurrent control group, increases in proportion of generic prescriptions (29.3{\%} to 31.4{\%} to 37.4{\%} in the pre-intervention, post-intervention, and end-of-study periods, respectively) were not commensurate with the intervention. There was a larger change in generic prescribing rates among authorized prescribers (24.6{\%}) than nurses (18.5{\%}; adjusted OR 1.38, 95{\%} CI 1.17 to 1.63). Two years after the intervention, the proportion of generic prescribing remained significantly higher for e-prescriptions (58.1{\%}; 95{\%} CI 57.5{\%} to 58.7{\%}) than for hand-generated prescriptions ordered at the same time (37.4{\%}; 95{\%} CI 34.9{\%} to 39.9{\%}) (p{\textless}0.0001). Generic prescribing increased significantly in every specialty.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Implementation of generic substitution decision support was associated with dramatic and sustained improvements in the rate of outpatient generic e-prescribing across all specialties.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Drug confusion is thought to be the most common type of dispensing error. Several strategies can be implemented to reduce the risk of medication errors. One of these are alerts in the pharmacy information system. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the experiences of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians with alerts for drug name and strength confusion. METHODS In May 2017, a cross-sectional survey of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians was performed in community pharmacies in the Netherlands using an online questionnaire. RESULTS Of the 269 respondents, 86{\%} (n = 230) had noticed the alert for drug name confusion, and 26{\%} (n = 67) for drug strength confusion. Of those 230, 9{\%} (n = 20) had experienced that the alert had prevented dispensing the wrong drug. For drug strength confusion, this proportion was 12{\%} (n = 8). Respondents preferred to have an alert for drug name and strength confusion in the pharmacy information system. 'Alert fatigue' was an important issue, so alerts should only be introduced for frequent confusions or confusions with serious consequences. CONCLUSION Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians were positive about having alerts for drug confusions in their pharmacy information system and experienced that alerts contributed to the prevention of dispensing errors. To prevent alert fatigue, it was considered important not to include all possible confusions as a new alert: the potential contribution to the prevention of drug confusion should be weighed against the risk of alert fatigue.},

DESIGN Systems analysis of events from a prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS All admissions to 11 medical and surgical units in two tertiary care hospitals over a 6-month period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Errors, proximal causes, and systems failures. METHODS Errors were detected by interviews of those involved. Errors were classified according to proximal cause and underlying systems failure by multidisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and systems analysts. RESULTS During this period, 334 errors were detected as the causes of 264 preventable ADEs and potential ADEs. Sixteen major systems failures were identified as the underlying causes of the errors. The most common systems failure was in the dissemination of drug knowledge, particularly to physicians, accounting for 29{\%} of the 334 errors. Inadequate availability of patient information, such as the results of laboratory tests, was associated with 18{\%} of errors. Seven systems failures accounted for 78{\%} of the errors; all could be improved by better information systems. CONCLUSIONS Hospital personnel willingly participated in the detection and investigation of drug use errors and were able to identify underlying systems failures. The most common defects were in systems to disseminate knowledge about drugs and to make drug and patient information readily accessible at the time it is needed. Systems changes to improve dissemination and display of drug and patient data should make errors in the use of drugs less likely.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many dispensing errors made in hospital pharmacies can harm patients. Some hospitals are investing in bar code technology to reduce these errors, but data about its efficacy are limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether implementation of bar code technology reduced dispensing errors and potential adverse drug events (ADEs). DESIGN: Before-and-after study using direct observations. SETTING: Hospital pharmacy at a 735-bed tertiary care academic medical center. INTERVENTION: A bar code-assisted dispensing system was implemented in 3 configurations. In 2 configurations, all doses were scanned once during the dispensing process. In the third configuration, only 1 dose was scanned if several doses of the same medication were being dispensed. MEASUREMENTS: Target dispensing errors, defined as dispensing errors that bar code technology was designed to address, and target potential ADEs, defined as target dispensing errors that can harm patients. RESULTS: In the pre- and post-bar code implementation periods, the authors observed 115,164 and 253,984 dispensed medication doses, respectively. Overall, the rates of target potential ADEs and all potential ADEs decreased by 74{\%} and 63{\%}, respectively. Of the 3 configurations of bar code technology studied, the 2 configurations that required staff to scan all doses had a 93{\%} to 96{\%} relative reduction in the incidence of target dispensing errors (P {\textless} 0.001) and 86{\%} to 97{\%} relative reduction in the incidence of potential ADEs (P {\textless} 0.001). However, the configuration that did not require scanning of every dose had only a 60{\%} relative reduction in the incidence of target dispensing errors (P {\textless} 0.001) and an increased (by 2.4-fold) incidence of target potential ADEs (P = 0.014). There were several potentially life-threatening ADEs involving intravenous dopamine and intravenous heparin in that configuration. LIMITATIONS: The authors used surrogate outcomes; did not mask assessors to the purpose of study; and excluded the controlled substance fill process (a process with low error rates at baseline) from the study, which may bias the combined decrease in error rates toward a larger magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: The overall rates of dispensing errors and potential ADEs substantially decreased after implementing bar code technology. However, the technology should be configured to scan every dose during the dispensing process.},

abstract = {Hemovigilance programs from around the world document that the greatest risk to recipients of blood transfusion is human error, resulting in transfusion of the incorrect blood component. Errors in transfusion care have strong parallels with errors in medication administration. Errors often result from 'lapse' or 'slip' mistakes in which details of patient identification are overlooked. Three areas of transfusion are focal points for improved care: the labelling of the patient's pre-transfusion sample, the decision to transfuse and the final bedside check designed to prevent mis-transfusion. Both barcodes and radio-frequency identification technology, each ideally suited to matching alpha-numeric identifiers, are being implemented in order to improve performance sample labelling and the bedside check. The decision to transfuse should ultimately be enhanced through the use of nanotechnology sensors, computerised order entry and decision support systems. Obstacles to the deployment of new technology include resistance to change, confusion regarding the best technology, and uncertainty regarding the return-on-investment. By focusing on overall transfusion safety, deploying validated systems appropriate for both medication and blood administration, thoughtful integration of technology into bedside practice and demonstration of improved performance, the application of new technologies will improve care for patients in need of transfusion therapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The results of a survey to characterize oncology drug shortages across the United States and the impact of shortages on clinical practice, patient safety, clinical trials, and health care costs are presented.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A 34-item online survey was distributed to 1672 members of the Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy Association and other organizations to gather information on shortages of oncology drugs (i.e., all drugs essential in the care of cancer patients, including supportive care agents).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Two hundred forty-three completed responses, almost all from pharmacists (97{\%}), were analyzed. Delays in chemotherapy administration or changes in treatment regimens due to drug shortages were reported by 93{\%} of survey participants; 85{\%} of respondents reported increased costs, and 10{\%} reported reimbursement challenges related to drug shortages. At 34{\%} of represented institutions, at least 1000 hours of additional labor annually was needed to manage shortages. Changes in therapy leading to near-miss errors were reported by 16{\%} of participants, with 6{\%} reporting one or more actual medication errors attributable to a drug shortage. The oncology medications most frequently reported to be in short supply during the preceding 12 months were fluorouracil, leucovorin, liposomal doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. The conduct of clinical trials was affected by drug shortages at 44{\%} of represented institutions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: A survey of U.S. oncology pharmacists indicated that oncology drug shortages occurred frequently in the first half of 2011. Shortages led to delays in chemotherapy and changes in therapy, complicated the conduct of clinical research, increased the risks of medication errors and adverse outcomes, and increased medication costs.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The impact of drug shortages on patient care, the resources used to manage drug shortages, and the cost associated with drug shortages were studied. METHODS: A national online survey was conducted to quantify the effects of drug shortages on patient care and pharmacy expenses. Directors of pharmacy in acute care institutions in the ASHP member database were asked to estimate the impact of drug shortages on acquisition costs, pharmacist and nonpharmacist staff time dedicated to specific functions related to drug shortages, and drug-compounding expenses. RESULTS: Usable responses were received from 370 (24.7{\%}) of 1496 pharmacy directors. Nearly all pharmacy directors surveyed believed that shortages had changed practice, and a majority felt that drug shortages had compromised patient care. Hospital pharmacy personnel devoted a significant amount of time to managing drug shortages. The results suggest that shortages increase the acquisition cost of pharmaceuticals in the United States by over dollar 99 million annually. CONCLUSION: A national survey indicated that drug shortages are having a significant impact on patient care activities and finances in hospitals},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug shortages pose a serious challenge for health care institutions, often interfering with patient care. A common practice during a drug shortage is to select an alternate therapeutic; however, these agents often present challenges and may create safety concerns. Patient harms including adverse events and medication errors may occur. Patients may also file complaints because of drug shortages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of drug shortages on patient outcomes, clinical pharmacy operations, patient complaints, and institutional cost.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: An e-mail link to an online survey was sent to pharmacy director members in the MedAssets Pharmacy Group Purchasing Organization. Data were collected within a 3-week period from October 2-23, 2012. The survey focused on 6 different domains: demographics, adverse events, medication errors, patient outcomes, patient complaints, and institutional cost.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The survey was sent to 1,516 directors of pharmacy. There were 193 respondents (response rate 13{\%}) who participated in the survey. Approximately 40{\%} of respondents reported between 1 and 5 adverse events probably or possibly associated with drug shortages at their institution. The majority of respondents reported between 1 and 10 medication errors. The most common types of medication errors reported were omission (n = 86, 55.5{\%}), wrong dose dispensed/administered (n = 85, 54.8{\%}), and wrong drug dispensed/administered (n = 54, 34.8{\%}). The most common outcomes reported by respondents were alternative medication used (n=146, 85.3{\%}), delay of therapy (n = 121, 70.8{\%}), and increased patient monitoring necessary (n = 84, 49.1{\%}). Patient complaints were reported by 38{\%} of respondents. The majority of respondents reported an estimated quarterly institutional cost from shortages of less than {\$}100,000, and approximately one quarter of respondents reported adding at least 1 full-time equivalent to manage drug shortages. The majority of participant comments mentioned the increasing institutional costs attributed to drug shortages.\backslashn\backslashnCONCLUSIONS: Medication errors and adverse events continue to occur from drug shortages, often resulting in inadequate patient care, high institutional costs, and patient complaints. Delayed care and cancelled care have been reported from shortages. Further research is necessary to better classify medication errors and adverse events during a drug shortage.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of prescribing errors identified by pharmacists in hospital inpatients and the factors influencing error identification rates by pharmacists throughout hospital admission. SETTING: 880-bed university teaching hospital in North-west England. METHODS: Data about prescribing errors identified by pharmacists (median: 9 (range 4-17) collecting data per day) when conducting routine work were prospectively recorded on 38 randomly selected days over 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of new medication orders in which an error was identified; predictors of error identification rate, adjusted for workload and seniority of pharmacist, day of week, type of ward or stage of patient admission. RESULTS: 33,012 new medication orders were reviewed for 5,199 patients; 3,455 errors (in 10.5{\%} of orders) were identified for 2,040 patients (39.2{\%}; median 1, range 1-12). Most were problem orders (1,456, 42.1{\%}) or potentially significant errors (1,748, 50.6{\%}); 197 (5.7{\%}) were potentially serious; 1.6{\%} (n = 54) were potentially severe or fatal. Errors were 41{\%} (CI: 28-56{\%}) more likely to be identified at patient's admission than at other times, independent of confounders. Workload was the strongest predictor of error identification rates, with 40{\%} (33-46{\%}) less errors identified on the busiest days than at other times. Errors identified fell by 1.9{\%} (1.5-2.3{\%}) for every additional chart checked, independent of confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists routinely identify errors but increasing workload may reduce identification rates. Where resources are limited, they may be better spent on identifying and addressing errors immediately after admission to hospital.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency, type, and consequences of medication errors in more stages of the medication process, including discharge summaries. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using three methods to detect errors in the medication process: direct observations, unannounced control visits, and chart reviews. With the exception of errors in discharge summaries all potential medication error consequences were evaluated by physicians and pharmacists. SETTING: A randomly selected medical and surgical department at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Eligible in-hospital patients aged 18 or over (n = 64), physicians prescribing drugs and nurses dispensing and administering drugs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency, type, and potential clinical consequences of all detected errors compared with the total number of opportunities for error. RESULTS: We detected a total of 1065 errors in 2467 opportunities for errors (43{\%}). In worst case scenario 20-30{\%} of all evaluated medication errors were assessed as potential adverse drug events. In each stage the frequency of medication errors were-ordering: 167/433 (39{\%}), transcription: 310/558 (56{\%}), dispensing: 22/538 (4{\%}), administration: 166/412 (41{\%}), and finally discharge summaries: 401/526 (76{\%}). The most common types of error throughout the medication process were: lack of drug form, unordered drug, omission of drug/dose, and lack of identity control. CONCLUSION: There is a need for quality improvement, as almost 50{\%} of all errors in doses and prescriptions in the medication process were caused by missing actions. We assume that the number of errors could be reduced by simple changes of existing procedures or by implementing automated technologies in the medication process.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Efforts to restrain pharmaceutical costs in the Norwegian hospital sector have focused on putting pharmaceuticals out to tender with resultant frequent changes in medicine inventories. Due to the extent of physicians failing to prescribe from the hospital drug list, the nurses have to perform generic substitution on the wards. The objective of the present study is to investigate the hospital nurses' experiences with generic substitution and to explore their views on this strategy as a risk factor for medication errors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Personal interviews with 100 nurses who were employed in a large Norwegian hospital were conducted using a semistructured questionnaire.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In all, 75{\%} of nurses thought it was problematic that the hospital's drug inventory was subject to frequent changes, and 91{\%} believed that the high number of generic products may contribute to erroneous dispensing. Nevertheless, three out of four admitted that they seldom or never verified the feasibility of the substitution with the physician, and that it was seldom documented in the medical charts. In total, 42{\%} of the nurses had experienced mistakes that occurred as a result of substitution. They claimed that the medication errors relating to generic substitution derived from difficult drug names, frequent changes in the drug inventory, and the increasing number of generic drugs, as well as from heavy workload and insufficient training.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that generic substitution is often carried out by nurses on the wards. The nurses feel insecure about the situation and report that they do not have the necessary training for the task. They clearly believe that a high number of generic drugs and frequent generic substitutions are risk factors for medication errors. Hence, hospital managers should be aware that such strategies to reduce costs may interfere with patient safety.},
