abstract = {From the very earliest moments in the modern history of the computer, scientists have dreamed of creating an " electronic brain " . Of all the modern technological quests, this search to create artificially intelligent (AI) computer systems has been one of the most ambitious and, not surprisingly, controversial. It also seems that very early on, scientists and doctors alike were captivated by the potential such a technology might have in medicine (e.g. Ledley and Lusted, 1959). With intelligent computers able to store and process vast stores of knowledge, the hope was that they would become perfect 'doctors in a box', assisting or surpassing clinicians with tasks like diagnosis. With such motivations, a small but talented community of computer scientists and healthcare professionals set about shaping a research program for a new discipline called Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM). These researchers had a bold vision of the way AIM would revolutionise medicine, and push forward the frontiers of technology. AI in medicine at that time was a largely US-based research community. },

abstract = {Risk factors play a central part in prediction and prevention. A critical issue in any discussion of risk factors is to ensure that the term risk factor, and associated terms such as correlate and marker, are defined in a precise, consistent manner.1 The starting point is to understand that a correlate is a variable that is associated, either positively or negatively, with an outcome. The presence or absence of a correlate can be measured in each subject. The term subject need not be an individual but could be a family, classroom, school, or an entire community. The outcomes can be dimensional, but they are restricted in this discussion to binary ones. Binary outcomes are the most relevant in medical practice. The physician and patient are concerned about whether the patient has or does not have the illness or disorder. The correlate can be measured at the same time as the outcome and thus be a concomitant of it, or it can be measured after the outcome and be a consequence or result of it. A risk factor can be considered a type of correlate. It is associated with an increased probability of an outcome, usually an unpleasant one. It has, however, a major distinguishing characteristic from other correlates, which is it occurs before the outcome. This is 1 of the 2 defining characteristics of a risk factor. The measure of the risk factor is taken on each subject before the subject has the outcome of interest. The second defining characteristic of a risk factor is that it can be used to divide a population into high risk and low risk subgroups. The probability of the outcome must be shown to be greater in the high risk compared with the low risk group. Thus, the 2 defining characteristics of a {\ldots}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized medical patients is largely underused. We sought to assess the value of a simple risk assessment model (RAM) for the identification of patients at risk of VTE.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMETHODS: In a prospective cohort study, 1180 consecutive patients admitted to a department of internal medicine in a 2-year period were classified as having a high or low risk of VTE according to a predefined RAM. They were followed-up for up to 90 days to assess the occurrence of symptomatic VTE complications. The primary study outcome was to assess the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of VTE in high-risk patients who had adequate in-hospital thromboprophylaxis in comparison with those who did not, and that of VTE in the latter group in comparison with low-risk patients.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nRESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-nine patients (39.7{\%}) were labelled as having a high risk of thrombosis. VTE developed in four of the 186 (2.2{\%}) who received thromboprophylaxis, and in 31 of the 283 (11.0{\%}) who did not (HR of VTE, 0.13; 95{\%} CI, 0.04-0.40). VTE developed also in two of the 711 (0.3{\%}) low-risk patients (HR of VTE in high-risk patients without prophylaxis as compared with low-risk patients, 32.0; 95{\%} CI, 4.1-251.0). Bleeding occurred in three of the 186 (1.6{\%}) high-risk patients who had thromboprophylaxis.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our RAM can help discriminate between medical patients at high and low risk of VTE. The adoption of adequate thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients during hospitalization leads to longstanding protection against thromboembolic events with a low risk of bleeding.},

abstract = {Background: The annual cost of morbidity and mortality due to medication errors in the U.S. has been estimated at {\$}76.6 billion. Information technology implemented systematically has the potential to significantly reduce medication errors that result in adverse drug events (ADEs). Objective: To develop a computer simulation model that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of information technology applications designed to detect and prevent medication errors that result in adverse drug effects. Methods: A computer simulation model Was constructed representing the medication delivery system in a hospital. STELLA, a continuous simulation software package, was used to construct the model. Parameters of the model were estimated from a study of prescription errors on two hospital medical/surgical units and used in the baseline simulation. Five prevention strategies were simulated based on information obtained from the literature. Results: The model simulates the four stages of the medication delivery system: prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, and administering drugs. We simulated interventions that have been demonstrated in prior studies to decrease error rates. The results suggest that an integrated medication delivery system can save up to 1,226 days of excess hospitalization and {\$}1.4 million in associated costs annually in a large hospital. The results of the analyses regarding the effects of the interventions on the additional hospital costs associated with ADEs are somewhat sensitive to the distribution of errors in the hospital, more sensitive to the costs of an ADE, and most sensitive to the proportion of medication errors resulting in ADEs. Conclusions: The results suggest that clinical information systems are potentially a cost-effective means of preventing ADEs in hospitals and demonstrate the importance of viewing medication errors from a systems perspective. Prevention efforts that focus on a single stage of the process had limited impact on the overall error rate. This study suggests that system-wide changes to the medication delivery system are required to drastically reduce mediation errors that may result in ADEs in a hospital setting.},

DESIGN Systems analysis of events from a prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS All admissions to 11 medical and surgical units in two tertiary care hospitals over a 6-month period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Errors, proximal causes, and systems failures. METHODS Errors were detected by interviews of those involved. Errors were classified according to proximal cause and underlying systems failure by multidisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and systems analysts. RESULTS During this period, 334 errors were detected as the causes of 264 preventable ADEs and potential ADEs. Sixteen major systems failures were identified as the underlying causes of the errors. The most common systems failure was in the dissemination of drug knowledge, particularly to physicians, accounting for 29{\%} of the 334 errors. Inadequate availability of patient information, such as the results of laboratory tests, was associated with 18{\%} of errors. Seven systems failures accounted for 78{\%} of the errors; all could be improved by better information systems. CONCLUSIONS Hospital personnel willingly participated in the detection and investigation of drug use errors and were able to identify underlying systems failures. The most common defects were in systems to disseminate knowledge about drugs and to make drug and patient information readily accessible at the time it is needed. Systems changes to improve dissemination and display of drug and patient data should make errors in the use of drugs less likely.},

abstract = {Medication error is an important cause of patient morbidity and mortality, yet it can be a confusing and underappreciated concept. This article provides a review for practicing physicians that focuses on medication error (1) terminology and definitions, (2) incidence, (3) risk factors, (4) avoidance strategies, and (5) disclosure and legal consequences. A medication error is any error that occurs at any point in the medication use process. It has been estimated by the Institute of Medicine that medication errors cause 1 of 131 outpatient and 1 of 854 inpatient deaths. Medication factors (eg, similar sounding names, low therapeutic index), patient factors (eg, poor renal or hepatic function, impaired cognition, polypharmacy), and health care professional factors (eg, use of abbreviations in prescriptions and other communications, cognitive biases) can precipitate medication errors. Consequences faced by physicians after medication errors can include loss of patient trust, civil actions, criminal charges, and medical board discipline. Methods to prevent medication errors from occurring (eg, use of information technology, better drug labeling, and medication reconciliation) have been used with varying success. When an error is discovered, patients expect disclosure that is timely, given in person, and accompanied with an apology and communication of efforts to prevent future errors. Learning more about medication errors may enhance health care professionals' ability to provide safe care to their patients. {\textcopyright} 2014 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.},

abstract = {This paper describes a prototype clinical decision support system (CDSS) for risk stratification of patients with cardiac chest pain. A newly developed belief rule-based inference methodology-RIMER was employed for developing the prototype. Based on the belief rule-based inference methodology, the prototype CDSS can deal with uncertainties in both clinical domain knowledge and clinical data. Moreover, the prototype can automatically update its knowledge base via a belief rule base (BRB) learning module which can adjust BRB through accumulated historical clinical cases. The domain specific knowledge used to construct the knowledge base of the prototype was learned from real patient data. We simulated a set of 1000 patients in cardiac chest pain to validate the prototype. The belief rule-based prototype CDSS has been found to perform extremely well. Firstly, the system can provide more reliable and informative diagnosis recommendations than manual diagnosis using traditional rules when there are clinical uncertainties. Secondly, the diagnostic performance of the system can be significantly improved after training the BRB through accumulated clinical cases. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Delays in chemotherapy administration or changes in treatment regimens due to drug shortages were reported by 93{\%} of survey participants; 85{\%} of respondents reported increased costs, and 10{\%} reported reimbursement challenges related to drug shortages. At 34{\%} of represented institutions, at least 1000 hours of additional labor annually was needed to manage shortages. Changes in therapy leading to near-miss errors were reported by 16{\%} of participants, with 6{\%} reporting one or more actual medication errors attributable to a drug shortage. The oncology medications most frequently reported to be in short supply during the preceding 12 months were fluorouracil, leucovorin, liposomal doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. The conduct of clinical trials was affected by drug shortages at 44{\%} of represented institutions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: A survey of U.S. oncology pharmacists indicated that oncology drug shortages occurred frequently in the first half of 2011. Shortages led to delays in chemotherapy and changes in therapy, complicated the conduct of clinical research, increased the risks of medication errors and adverse outcomes, and increased medication costs.},

abstract = {Risks to human beings arise from an inherent characteristic to make plans and try to make them happen, while external forces resist and tend to move our endeavours away from the plan. Any such "endeavour" is a complex ensemble of a bewildering variety of interacting elements which together form something "whole", usually called a "system" (e.g. a chemical process plant, a nuclear power plant, the stock market, air traffic control). A system has a certain state in the present and subsequent states in the future. There are deterministic and probabilistic systems and corresponding approaches to analyse them, that is to make their current states apparent and predict their future behaviour. In this paper, it is shown in which ways both analyses appear in risk analysis and it is hypothesised that both approaches are modelling the same process, though probabilistic analysis may reveal more information since it explicitly incorporates uncertainty in the form of numbers (and "there is safety in numbers"). The overall objective of this paper is to make clear what the differences between the two approaches really are. Their respective main strengths and weaknesses are discussed. A more refined objective is to discuss the specific role of probabilities in risk analysis. Examples of both approaches are given from applications in the nuclear power and chemical process industries, and some of the main problems encountered thereby are identified. Further, the challenge to system analysis posed by "chaos theory" is discussed. Due to its non-linear dynamic character, the future behaviour of a "chaotic system" is difficult to predict over a long period of time because it depends on arbitrarily small and thus not observable variations in the current state. Such behaviour might have serious consequences for human operators involved in the control of such systems. The paper concludes that, although both approaches to risk analysis can provide adequate safety levels to systems if applied in a correct and non-biased way, probabilistic methods seem to be more cost-effective and the results easier to communicate to decision- and policy-makers.},

Concordance analysis of data related to the pictures of possibly similar packaging and labels was validated using the Kappa index.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of all drugs evaluated (n = 150), about 43{\%} of "possibly similar drugs" were in the central pharmacy (n = 65) and were related to small-volume parenteral solutions. The strength of interobserver agreement in the category "very similar to each other" was considered "satisfactory" (Kappa = 0584) in 90.66{\%} of the drugs evaluated (n = 136). The overall Kappa analysis of the study was 0.488. Variables with statistical significance were: "same color label or packaging", with the respective percentages for both primary and secondary packaging (52{\%}-44{\%}), p = 0.028; the variable "same color of drug presentation" obtained similar values and statistical significance to the previous variable; for the variable "same arrangement of words", the values found for both packages were close to 50{\%}, p = 0.001; and for the variable "same color of the words", the percentages were: (50.7{\%} - 44{\%}) (p = 0.008).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate similarities related to the labeling of drugs with potential for errors, especially in dispensing, storage, and administration if preventive measures are not adopted.},

abstract = {We discuss in this paper the extent to which disease risk factors may assist in the diagnostic process. We caution that disease risk factors need not be very sensitive or specific. Risk factor specificity and sensitivity may be further reduced if, in the former case, the risk factor is related to other illnesses having the same clinical presentation as the disease of interest, or if, in the latter case, the risk factor disappears with the onset of illness. We illustrate these points in a discussion of the utility of smoking as a diagnostic test for malignancy in two clinical situations, the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria and the patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule. Risk factors hold great promise as aids to medical diagnosis, as this information is readily available to clinicians at little or no cost. Clinicians, however, should exercise caution when using risk factors of unproven diagnostic utility in medical diagnosis, as their presence may have little or no effect on disease probability. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Hemovigilance programs from around the world document that the greatest risk to recipients of blood transfusion is human error, resulting in transfusion of the incorrect blood component. Errors in transfusion care have strong parallels with errors in medication administration. Errors often result from 'lapse' or 'slip' mistakes in which details of patient identification are overlooked. Three areas of transfusion are focal points for improved care: the labelling of the patient's pre-transfusion sample, the decision to transfuse and the final bedside check designed to prevent mis-transfusion. Both barcodes and radio-frequency identification technology, each ideally suited to matching alpha-numeric identifiers, are being implemented in order to improve performance sample labelling and the bedside check. The decision to transfuse should ultimately be enhanced through the use of nanotechnology sensors, computerised order entry and decision support systems. Obstacles to the deployment of new technology include resistance to change, confusion regarding the best technology, and uncertainty regarding the return-on-investment. By focusing on overall transfusion safety, deploying validated systems appropriate for both medication and blood administration, thoughtful integration of technology into bedside practice and demonstration of improved performance, the application of new technologies will improve care for patients in need of transfusion therapy.},

abstract = {Background. Risk-adjusted mortality rates are used to compare quality of care of different hospitals. We evaluated the EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).Patients and method. Data of all CABG patients from January 2004 until December 2008 were analysed. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves for the additive and logistic EuroSCOREs and the areas under the ROC curve were calculated. Predicted probability of hospital mortality was calculated using logistic regression analyses and compared with the EuroSCORE. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) analyses were performed for the EuroSCORE and the actual hospital mortality.Results. 5249 patients underwent CABG of which 89 (1.7{\%}) died. The mean additive EuroSCORE was 3.5+/-2.5 (0-17) (median 3.0) and the mean logistic EuroSCORE was 4.0+/-5.5 (0-73) (median 2.4). The area under the ROC curve was 0.80+/-0.02 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.84) for the additive and 0.81+/-0.02 (0.77 to 0.85) for the logistic EuroSCORE. The predicted probability (hazard ratio) was different from the additive and logistic EuroSCOREs. The hospital mortality was half of the EuroSCOREs, resulting in positive variable life-adjusted display curves. Conclusions. Both the additive and logistic EuroSCOREs are overestimating the in-hospital mortality risk in low-risk CABG patients. The logistic EuroSCORE is more accurate in high-risk patients compared with the additive EuroSCORE. Until a more accurate risk scoring system is available, we suggest being careful when comparing the quality of care of different centres based on risk-adjusted mortality rates.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of prescribing errors identified by pharmacists in hospital inpatients and the factors influencing error identification rates by pharmacists throughout hospital admission. SETTING: 880-bed university teaching hospital in North-west England. METHODS: Data about prescribing errors identified by pharmacists (median: 9 (range 4-17) collecting data per day) when conducting routine work were prospectively recorded on 38 randomly selected days over 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of new medication orders in which an error was identified; predictors of error identification rate, adjusted for workload and seniority of pharmacist, day of week, type of ward or stage of patient admission. RESULTS: 33,012 new medication orders were reviewed for 5,199 patients; 3,455 errors (in 10.5{\%} of orders) were identified for 2,040 patients (39.2{\%}; median 1, range 1-12). Most were problem orders (1,456, 42.1{\%}) or potentially significant errors (1,748, 50.6{\%}); 197 (5.7{\%}) were potentially serious; 1.6{\%} (n = 54) were potentially severe or fatal. Errors were 41{\%} (CI: 28-56{\%}) more likely to be identified at patient's admission than at other times, independent of confounders. Workload was the strongest predictor of error identification rates, with 40{\%} (33-46{\%}) less errors identified on the busiest days than at other times. Errors identified fell by 1.9{\%} (1.5-2.3{\%}) for every additional chart checked, independent of confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists routinely identify errors but increasing workload may reduce identification rates. Where resources are limited, they may be better spent on identifying and addressing errors immediately after admission to hospital.},

METHODS: A national online survey was conducted to quantify the effects of drug shortages on patient care and pharmacy expenses. Directors of pharmacy in acute care institutions in the ASHP member database were asked to estimate the impact of drug shortages on acquisition costs, pharmacist and nonpharmacist staff time dedicated to specific functions related to drug shortages, and drug-compounding expenses. RESULTS: Usable responses were received from 370 (24.7{\%}) of 1496 pharmacy directors. Nearly all pharmacy directors surveyed believed that shortages had changed practice, and a majority felt that drug shortages had compromised patient care. Hospital pharmacy personnel devoted a significant amount of time to managing drug shortages. The results suggest that shortages increase the acquisition cost of pharmaceuticals in the United States by over dollar 99 million annually. CONCLUSION: A national survey indicated that drug shortages are having a significant impact on patient care activities and finances in hospitals},

The three algorithms were used to unduplicate an administrative database containing personal identifiers for over 500,000 clients. Subsequently, a random sample of linked records was submitted to four research staff for blinded clerical review. Using reviewers' decisions as the 'gold standard', sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPVs) were estimated. Optimally, sensitivity and PPVs in the mid 90s could be obtained from both The Link King and Link Plus. Sensitivity and PPVs using a basic deterministic algorithm were 79 and 98 per cent respectively. Thus the full feature set of The Link King makes it an attractive option for SAS users. Link Plus is a good choice for non-SAS users as long as necessary programming resources are available for processing record pairs identified by Link Plus.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to pilot test a screening approach to detect potential look-alike, sound-alike (LASA) errors in pediatric outpatient prescriptions. Method: Medicaid pharmacy claims from one state were reviewed. From a list of LASA drug pairs, we identified candidate pairs meeting the following criteria: 1) one drug was commonly prescribed in children; 2) the paired drug was uncommonly prescribed for children; and 3) both drugs were available as oral preparations only, resulting in 11 LASA pairs. We identified patients who usually received one drug in a pair, then presented with a first dispensing of the paired drug, representing a "screening alert" for potential LASA error. We determined a "true error" as any patient who triggered a screening alert, received only one dispensing of the paired drug in the subsequent 6 months, and had no diagnoses supporting the dispensing of the paired drug. Results: Among the 22 test drugs, there were 1 420 091 prescriptions to 173 005 subjects. There were 395 screening alerts generated, representing a screening alert frequency of 0.28 screening alerts per 1000 prescriptions. We identified 43 true LASA errors. In the dataset, the overall LASA error rate is estimated to be approximately 0.00003{\%}, or 0.03 LASA errors per 1000 prescriptions. Conclusion: Prescription dispensing patterns can be used to screen for LASA errors in pediatric prescriptions. The rates of pediatric LASA errors appear to be much lower than other types of pediatric medication errors and may be best addressed by automated processes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug shortages pose a serious challenge for health care institutions, often interfering with patient care. A common practice during a drug shortage is to select an alternate therapeutic; however, these agents often present challenges and may create safety concerns. Patient harms including adverse events and medication errors may occur. Patients may also file complaints because of drug shortages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of drug shortages on patient outcomes, clinical pharmacy operations, patient complaints, and institutional cost.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: An e-mail link to an online survey was sent to pharmacy director members in the MedAssets Pharmacy Group Purchasing Organization. Data were collected within a 3-week period from October 2-23, 2012. The survey focused on 6 different domains: demographics, adverse events, medication errors, patient outcomes, patient complaints, and institutional cost.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The survey was sent to 1,516 directors of pharmacy. There were 193 respondents (response rate 13{\%}) who participated in the survey. Approximately 40{\%} of respondents reported between 1 and 5 adverse events probably or possibly associated with drug shortages at their institution. The majority of respondents reported between 1 and 10 medication errors. The most common types of medication errors reported were omission (n = 86, 55.5{\%}), wrong dose dispensed/administered (n = 85, 54.8{\%}), and wrong drug dispensed/administered (n = 54, 34.8{\%}). The most common outcomes reported by respondents were alternative medication used (n=146, 85.3{\%}), delay of therapy (n = 121, 70.8{\%}), and increased patient monitoring necessary (n = 84, 49.1{\%}). Patient complaints were reported by 38{\%} of respondents. The majority of respondents reported an estimated quarterly institutional cost from shortages of less than {\$}100,000, and approximately one quarter of respondents reported adding at least 1 full-time equivalent to manage drug shortages. The majority of participant comments mentioned the increasing institutional costs attributed to drug shortages.\backslashn\backslashnCONCLUSIONS: Medication errors and adverse events continue to occur from drug shortages, often resulting in inadequate patient care, high institutional costs, and patient complaints. Delayed care and cancelled care have been reported from shortages. Further research is necessary to better classify medication errors and adverse events during a drug shortage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many dispensing errors made in hospital pharmacies can harm patients. Some hospitals are investing in bar code technology to reduce these errors, but data about its efficacy are limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether implementation of bar code technology reduced dispensing errors and potential adverse drug events (ADEs). DESIGN: Before-and-after study using direct observations. SETTING: Hospital pharmacy at a 735-bed tertiary care academic medical center. INTERVENTION: A bar code-assisted dispensing system was implemented in 3 configurations. In 2 configurations, all doses were scanned once during the dispensing process. In the third configuration, only 1 dose was scanned if several doses of the same medication were being dispensed. MEASUREMENTS: Target dispensing errors, defined as dispensing errors that bar code technology was designed to address, and target potential ADEs, defined as target dispensing errors that can harm patients. RESULTS: In the pre- and post-bar code implementation periods, the authors observed 115,164 and 253,984 dispensed medication doses, respectively. Overall, the rates of target potential ADEs and all potential ADEs decreased by 74{\%} and 63{\%}, respectively. Of the 3 configurations of bar code technology studied, the 2 configurations that required staff to scan all doses had a 93{\%} to 96{\%} relative reduction in the incidence of target dispensing errors (P {\textless} 0.001) and 86{\%} to 97{\%} relative reduction in the incidence of potential ADEs (P {\textless} 0.001). However, the configuration that did not require scanning of every dose had only a 60{\%} relative reduction in the incidence of target dispensing errors (P {\textless} 0.001) and an increased (by 2.4-fold) incidence of target potential ADEs (P = 0.014). There were several potentially life-threatening ADEs involving intravenous dopamine and intravenous heparin in that configuration. LIMITATIONS: The authors used surrogate outcomes; did not mask assessors to the purpose of study; and excluded the controlled substance fill process (a process with low error rates at baseline) from the study, which may bias the combined decrease in error rates toward a larger magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: The overall rates of dispensing errors and potential ADEs substantially decreased after implementing bar code technology. However, the technology should be configured to scan every dose during the dispensing process.},

abstract = {To address the recognized problems associated with information overload and limited human memory, computer based systems which help healthcare providers use information to make better decisions have been developed and implemented. These decision aids are designed to improve the quality and reduce the cost of healthcare. Currently, the most widely used computer application is to simply provide needed facts about the patient in an organized and timely fashion. Additionally, healthcare workers can access literature, ask questions of aggregates of patient data for clinical or administrative decisions, receive warnings or suggestions when the patient's data satisfy certain logical rules, receive critiques when proposing therapies or ordering diagnostic tests, receive guidelines for standards of care, access programs which analyze tradeoffs and likelihoods of alternative outcomes (decision analysis) and receive lists of differential diagnoses. Given this wonderful panoply of capabilities, the question becomes 'why aren't more people using these aids and what are the demonstrated benefits of such capabilities?' In this paper we review the types of decision aids which have been successfully implemented and the challenges to implementation (knowledge representation, connections to databases, need for comprehensive, coded databases and evaluation of benefits).},

We show that a normalized Levenshtein distance function can efficiently and reliably simulate bilingual orthographic similarity ratings. Orthographic similarity distributions of cognates and non-cognates were identified across pairs of six European languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch. Semantic equivalence was determined using the conceptual structure of a translation database. By using a similarity threshold, large numbers of cognates could be selected that nearly completely included the stimulus materials of experimental studies. The identified numbers of form-similar and identical cognates correlated highly with branch lengths of phylogenetic language family trees, supporting the usefulness of the new measure for cross-language comparison. The normalized Levenshtein distance function can be considered as a new formal model of cross-language orthographic similarity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency, type, and consequences of medication errors in more stages of the medication process, including discharge summaries. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using three methods to detect errors in the medication process: direct observations, unannounced control visits, and chart reviews. With the exception of errors in discharge summaries all potential medication error consequences were evaluated by physicians and pharmacists. SETTING: A randomly selected medical and surgical department at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Eligible in-hospital patients aged 18 or over (n = 64), physicians prescribing drugs and nurses dispensing and administering drugs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency, type, and potential clinical consequences of all detected errors compared with the total number of opportunities for error. RESULTS: We detected a total of 1065 errors in 2467 opportunities for errors (43{\%}). In worst case scenario 20-30{\%} of all evaluated medication errors were assessed as potential adverse drug events. In each stage the frequency of medication errors were-ordering: 167/433 (39{\%}), transcription: 310/558 (56{\%}), dispensing: 22/538 (4{\%}), administration: 166/412 (41{\%}), and finally discharge summaries: 401/526 (76{\%}). The most common types of error throughout the medication process were: lack of drug form, unordered drug, omission of drug/dose, and lack of identity control. CONCLUSION: There is a need for quality improvement, as almost 50{\%} of all errors in doses and prescriptions in the medication process were caused by missing actions. We assume that the number of errors could be reduced by simple changes of existing procedures or by implementing automated technologies in the medication process.},

abstract = {Objective Look-alike, sound-alike (LASA) drug name substitution errors in children may pose potentially severe consequences. Our objective was to determine the degree of potential harm pediatricians ascribe to specific ambulatory LASA drug substitution errors. Methods We developed a unified list of LASA pairs from published sources, removing selected drugs on the basis of preparation type (eg, injectable drugs). Using a modified Delphi method over 3 rounds, 38 practicing pediatricians estimated degree of potential harm that might occur should a patient receive the delivered drug in error and the degree of potential harm that might occur from not receiving the intended drug. Results We identified 3550 published LASA drug pairs. A total of 1834 pairs were retained for the Delphi surveys, and 608 drug pairs were retained for round 3. Final scoring demonstrated that participants were able to identify pairs where the substitutions represented high risk of harm for receiving the delivered drug in error (eg, did not receive methylphenidate/received methadone), high risk of harm for not receiving the intended drug (eg, did not receive furosemide/received fosinopril), and pairs where the potential harm was high from not receiving the intended drug and from erroneously receiving the delivered drug (eg, did not receive albuterol/received labetalol). Conclusions Pediatricians have identified LASA drug substitutions that pose a high potential risk of harm to children. These results will allow future efforts to prioritize pediatric LASA errors that can be screened prospectively in outpatient pharmacies.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Efforts to restrain pharmaceutical costs in the Norwegian hospital sector have focused on putting pharmaceuticals out to tender with resultant frequent changes in medicine inventories. Due to the extent of physicians failing to prescribe from the hospital drug list, the nurses have to perform generic substitution on the wards. The objective of the present study is to investigate the hospital nurses' experiences with generic substitution and to explore their views on this strategy as a risk factor for medication errors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Personal interviews with 100 nurses who were employed in a large Norwegian hospital were conducted using a semistructured questionnaire.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In all, 75{\%} of nurses thought it was problematic that the hospital's drug inventory was subject to frequent changes, and 91{\%} believed that the high number of generic products may contribute to erroneous dispensing. Nevertheless, three out of four admitted that they seldom or never verified the feasibility of the substitution with the physician, and that it was seldom documented in the medical charts. In total, 42{\%} of the nurses had experienced mistakes that occurred as a result of substitution. They claimed that the medication errors relating to generic substitution derived from difficult drug names, frequent changes in the drug inventory, and the increasing number of generic drugs, as well as from heavy workload and insufficient training.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that generic substitution is often carried out by nurses on the wards. The nurses feel insecure about the situation and report that they do not have the necessary training for the task. They clearly believe that a high number of generic drugs and frequent generic substitutions are risk factors for medication errors. Hence, hospital managers should be aware that such strategies to reduce costs may interfere with patient safety.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Drug confusion is thought to be the most common type of dispensing error. Several strategies can be implemented to reduce the risk of medication errors. One of these are alerts in the pharmacy information system. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the experiences of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians with alerts for drug name and strength confusion. METHODS In May 2017, a cross-sectional survey of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians was performed in community pharmacies in the Netherlands using an online questionnaire. RESULTS Of the 269 respondents, 86{\%} (n = 230) had noticed the alert for drug name confusion, and 26{\%} (n = 67) for drug strength confusion. Of those 230, 9{\%} (n = 20) had experienced that the alert had prevented dispensing the wrong drug. For drug strength confusion, this proportion was 12{\%} (n = 8). Respondents preferred to have an alert for drug name and strength confusion in the pharmacy information system. 'Alert fatigue' was an important issue, so alerts should only be introduced for frequent confusions or confusions with serious consequences. CONCLUSION Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians were positive about having alerts for drug confusions in their pharmacy information system and experienced that alerts contributed to the prevention of dispensing errors. To prevent alert fatigue, it was considered important not to include all possible confusions as a new alert: the potential contribution to the prevention of drug confusion should be weighed against the risk of alert fatigue.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Optimal decisions about the use of antibiotics and other antiinfective agents in critically ill patients require access to a large amount of complex information. We have developed a computerized decision-support program linked to computer-based patient records that can assist physicians in the use of antiinfective agents and improve the quality of care. This program presents epidemiologic information, along with detailed recommendations and warnings. The program recommends antiinfective regimens and courses of therapy for particular patients and provides immediate feedback. We prospectively studied the use of the computerized antiinfectives-management program for one year in a 12-bed intensive care unit. RESULTS: During the intervention period, all 545 patients admitted were cared for with the aid of the antiinfectives-management program. Measures of processes and outcomes were compared with those for the 1136 patients admitted to the same unit during the two years before the intervention period. The use of the program led to significant reductions in orders for drugs to which the patients had reported allergies (35, vs. 146 during the preintervention period; P{\textless}0.01), excess drug dosages (87 vs. 405, P{\textless}0.01), and antibiotic-susceptibility mismatches (12 vs. 206, P{\textless}0.01). There were also marked reductions in the mean number of days of excessive drug dosage (2.7 vs. 5.9, P{\textless}0.002) and in adverse events caused by antiinfective agents (4 vs. 28, P{\textless}0.02). In analyses of patients who received antiinfective agents, those treated during the intervention period who always received the regimens recommended by the computer program (n=203) had significant reductions, as compared with those who did not always receive the recommended regimens (n= 195) and those in the preintervention cohort (n = 766), in the cost of antiinfective agents (adjusted mean, {\$}102 vs. {\$}427 and {\$}340, respectively; P{\textless}0.001), in total hospital costs (adjusted mean, {\$}26,315 vs. {\$}44,865 and {\$}35,283; P{\textless}0.001), and in the length of the hospital stay days (adjusted mean, 10.0 vs. 16.7 and 12.9; P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS; A computerized antiinfectives-management program can improve the quality of patient care and reduce costs.},

abstract = {In its 2006 report "Preventing Medication Errors," the Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimated that more than 1.5 million preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) occur annually in the United States. Many organizations, including the IOM, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the Leap Frog Group for Patient Safety have advocated the implementation of technologies to reduce ADEs, particularly in the hospital setting. Many technologies have emerged in recent years to reduce ADEs at various points in the medication use process; however, interfacing some of these key technologies with existing hospital systems poses significant challenges.},

abstract = {Deterministic risk assessments provide a single point estimate of risk at a site of concern, while probabilistic risk assessment methods generate a range of values from probability distribution functions (PDFs). This study compares deterministic and probabilistic risk assessment methods for two different sites using uncertainty analysis and evaluates the use of toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in each method. The use of TEFs allowed more of the PAHs to be included which resulted in higher risk estimates for both adults and children at both study sites. Exposure factor variability generated greater uncertainty in risk estimates than sample heterogeneity or toxicity estimates. TEFs allowed for a more complete representation of the toxicity contributions from PAH species present at the study sites. Exposure factor distributions together with TEF estimations for toxicity of PAH species provide an assessment that can reduce and account for uncertainty. Probabilistic risk estimates provide a sensible improvement to deterministic risk estimates by generating a range of risk values, along with an average estimate and the degree of conservatism of those estimates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Medication errors are frequent and may cause harm to patients and increase healthcare expenses. AIM To explore whether a new labelling influences time and errors when preparing medications in accordance with medication charts in an experimental setting. METHOD We carried out an uncontrolled before and after study with 3 months inbetween experiments. Phase I used original labelling and phase II used new generic labelling. We set up an experimental medicine room, simulating a real-life setting. Twenty-five nurses and ten pharmacy technicians participated in the study. We asked them to prepare medications in accordance with medication charts, place packages on a desk and document the package prepared. We timed the operation. Participants were asked to prepare medications in accordance with as many charts as possible within 30 min. RESULTS Nurses prepared significantly more medication charts with the generic labelling compared with the original 3.3 versus 2.6 (p=0.009). Mean time per medication chart was significantly lower with the generic labelling 6.9 min/chart versus 8.5 min/chart (p{\textless}0.001). Pharmacy technicians were significantly faster than the nurses in both phase I (6.8 min/chart vs 9.5 min/chart; p{\textless}0.001) and phase II (6.1 min/chart vs 7.2 min/chart; p=0.013). The number of errors was low and not significantly different between the two labellings, with errors affecting 9.1{\%} of charts in phase I versus 6.5{\%} in phase II (p=0.5). CONCLUSIONS A new labelling of medication packages with prominent placement of the active substance(s) and strength(s) in the front of the medication package may reduce time for nurses when preparing medications, without increasing medication errors.},

Perhaps it is because decision making is such a commonplace activity that it is assumed we can all make effective decisions. However, this is not the case and the example of diagnostic error supports this assertion. Until quite recently there has been a general nihilism about the ability to change the way that we think, but it is now becoming accepted that if we can think about, and understand, our thinking processes we can improve our decision making, including diagnosis. In this paper we review the dual process model of decision making and highlight ways in which decision making can be improved through the application of this model to our day-to-day practice and by the adoption of de-biasing strategies and critical thinking.},

Use of medicines forms a large part of healthcare facility. As the number of medicines and brands are ever increasing in today's market, it is usual for pharmacy to substitute a generic instead of the prescribed brand or a different brand if the prescribed brand is not available. Depending on the type of substitute, it could fall under 'generic' or 'therapeutic' substitution. For any condition, there may be numerous medicines existing, some of which probably got introduced more recently, may be more expensive and erroneously perceived to act better than the earlier known medications for the same ailment. Also, due to very high number of medicines that are approved and available for use in the market, it is impossible to stock all the medicines in any pharmacy. Generic and therapeutic substitutions should be formalised and implemented by institutions, with the consent and cooperation of all the stake holders as guided by World Health Organisation. The advantages and limitations of medicine substitutes are discussed in the review.},

abstract = {To develop a simple, valid model to identify patients at high risk of opioid overdose-related hospitalization and mortality, Oregon prescription drug monitoring program, Vital Records, and Hospital Discharge data were linked to estimate 2 logistic models; a first model that included a broad range of risk factors from the literature and a second simplified model. Receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, and specificity of the models were analyzed. Variables retained in the final model were categories such as older than 35 years, number of prescribers, number of pharmacies, and prescriptions for long-acting opioids, benzodiazepines or sedatives, or carisoprodol. The ability of the model to discriminate between patients who did and did not overdose was reasonably good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.82, Nagelkerke R = 0.11). The positive predictive value of the model was low. Computationally simple models can identify high-risk patients based on prescription history alone, but improvement of the predictive value of models may require information from outside the prescription drug monitoring program. Patient or prescription features that predict opioid overdose may differ from those that predict diversion.},

Prenatal risk assessment is based on multiple clinical variables and overall performance is defined by how well the risk algorithm is optimized for the population in question. This article evaluates machine learning algorithms to improve performance of first trimester screening of Down syndrome. Machine learning algorithms pose an adaptive alternative to develop better risk assessment models using the existing clinical variables. Two real-world data sets were used to experiment with multiple classification algorithms. Implemented models were tested with a third, real-world, data set and performance was compared to a predicate method, a commercial risk assessment software. Best performing deep neural network model gave an area under the curve of 0.96 and detection rate of 78{\%} with 1{\%} false positive rate with the test data. Support vector machine model gave area under the curve of 0.95 and detection rate of 61{\%} with 1{\%} false positive rate with the same test data. When compared with the predicate method, the best support vector machine model was slightly inferior, but an optimized deep neural network model was able to give higher detection rates with same false positive rate or similar detection rate but with markedly lower false positive rate. This finding could further improve the first trimester screening for Down syndrome, by using existing clinical variables and a large training data derived from a specific population.},
