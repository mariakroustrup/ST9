abstract = {OBJECTIVE To identify and evaluate the systems failures that underlie errors causing adverse drug events (ADEs) and potential ADEs. DESIGN Systems analysis of events from a prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS All admissions to 11 medical and surgical units in two tertiary care hospitals over a 6-month period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Errors, proximal causes, and systems failures. METHODS Errors were detected by interviews of those involved. Errors were classified according to proximal cause and underlying systems failure by multidisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and systems analysts. RESULTS During this period, 334 errors were detected as the causes of 264 preventable ADEs and potential ADEs. Sixteen major systems failures were identified as the underlying causes of the errors. The most common systems failure was in the dissemination of drug knowledge, particularly to physicians, accounting for 29{\%} of the 334 errors. Inadequate availability of patient information, such as the results of laboratory tests, was associated with 18{\%} of errors. Seven systems failures accounted for 78{\%} of the errors; all could be improved by better information systems. CONCLUSIONS Hospital personnel willingly participated in the detection and investigation of drug use errors and were able to identify underlying systems failures. The most common defects were in systems to disseminate knowledge about drugs and to make drug and patient information readily accessible at the time it is needed. Systems changes to improve dissemination and display of drug and patient data should make errors in the use of drugs less likely.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many dispensing errors made in hospital pharmacies can harm patients. Some hospitals are investing in bar code technology to reduce these errors, but data about its efficacy are limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether implementation of bar code technology reduced dispensing errors and potential adverse drug events (ADEs). DESIGN: Before-and-after study using direct observations. SETTING: Hospital pharmacy at a 735-bed tertiary care academic medical center. INTERVENTION: A bar code-assisted dispensing system was implemented in 3 configurations. In 2 configurations, all doses were scanned once during the dispensing process. In the third configuration, only 1 dose was scanned if several doses of the same medication were being dispensed. MEASUREMENTS: Target dispensing errors, defined as dispensing errors that bar code technology was designed to address, and target potential ADEs, defined as target dispensing errors that can harm patients. RESULTS: In the pre- and post-bar code implementation periods, the authors observed 115,164 and 253,984 dispensed medication doses, respectively. Overall, the rates of target potential ADEs and all potential ADEs decreased by 74{\%} and 63{\%}, respectively. Of the 3 configurations of bar code technology studied, the 2 configurations that required staff to scan all doses had a 93{\%} to 96{\%} relative reduction in the incidence of target dispensing errors (P {\textless} 0.001) and 86{\%} to 97{\%} relative reduction in the incidence of potential ADEs (P {\textless} 0.001). However, the configuration that did not require scanning of every dose had only a 60{\%} relative reduction in the incidence of target dispensing errors (P {\textless} 0.001) and an increased (by 2.4-fold) incidence of target potential ADEs (P = 0.014). There were several potentially life-threatening ADEs involving intravenous dopamine and intravenous heparin in that configuration. LIMITATIONS: The authors used surrogate outcomes; did not mask assessors to the purpose of study; and excluded the controlled substance fill process (a process with low error rates at baseline) from the study, which may bias the combined decrease in error rates toward a larger magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: The overall rates of dispensing errors and potential ADEs substantially decreased after implementing bar code technology. However, the technology should be configured to scan every dose during the dispensing process.},

abstract = {Hemovigilance programs from around the world document that the greatest risk to recipients of blood transfusion is human error, resulting in transfusion of the incorrect blood component. Errors in transfusion care have strong parallels with errors in medication administration. Errors often result from 'lapse' or 'slip' mistakes in which details of patient identification are overlooked. Three areas of transfusion are focal points for improved care: the labelling of the patient's pre-transfusion sample, the decision to transfuse and the final bedside check designed to prevent mis-transfusion. Both barcodes and radio-frequency identification technology, each ideally suited to matching alpha-numeric identifiers, are being implemented in order to improve performance sample labelling and the bedside check. The decision to transfuse should ultimately be enhanced through the use of nanotechnology sensors, computerised order entry and decision support systems. Obstacles to the deployment of new technology include resistance to change, confusion regarding the best technology, and uncertainty regarding the return-on-investment. By focusing on overall transfusion safety, deploying validated systems appropriate for both medication and blood administration, thoughtful integration of technology into bedside practice and demonstration of improved performance, the application of new technologies will improve care for patients in need of transfusion therapy.},

Delays in chemotherapy administration or changes in treatment regimens due to drug shortages were reported by 93{\%} of survey participants; 85{\%} of respondents reported increased costs, and 10{\%} reported reimbursement challenges related to drug shortages. At 34{\%} of represented institutions, at least 1000 hours of additional labor annually was needed to manage shortages. Changes in therapy leading to near-miss errors were reported by 16{\%} of participants, with 6{\%} reporting one or more actual medication errors attributable to a drug shortage. The oncology medications most frequently reported to be in short supply during the preceding 12 months were fluorouracil, leucovorin, liposomal doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. The conduct of clinical trials was affected by drug shortages at 44{\%} of represented institutions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: A survey of U.S. oncology pharmacists indicated that oncology drug shortages occurred frequently in the first half of 2011.

METHODS: A national online survey was conducted to quantify the effects of drug shortages on patient care and pharmacy expenses. Directors of pharmacy in acute care institutions in the ASHP member database were asked to estimate the impact of drug shortages on acquisition costs, pharmacist and nonpharmacist staff time dedicated to specific functions related to drug shortages, and drug-compounding expenses. RESULTS: Usable responses were received from 370 (24.7{\%}) of 1496 pharmacy directors. Nearly all pharmacy directors surveyed believed that shortages had changed practice, and a majority felt that drug shortages had compromised patient care. Hospital pharmacy personnel devoted a significant amount of time to managing drug shortages. The results suggest that shortages increase the acquisition cost of pharmaceuticals in the United States by over dollar 99 million annually. CONCLUSION: A national survey indicated that drug shortages are having a significant impact on patient care activities and finances in hospitals},

A common practice during a drug shortage is to select an alternate therapeutic; however, these agents often present challenges and may create safety concerns. Patient harms including adverse events and medication errors may occur. Patients may also file complaints because of drug shortages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of drug shortages on patient outcomes, clinical pharmacy operations, patient complaints, and institutional cost.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: An e-mail link to an online survey was sent to pharmacy director members in the MedAssets Pharmacy Group Purchasing Organization. Data were collected within a 3-week period from October 2-23, 2012. The survey focused on 6 different domains: demographics, adverse events, medication errors, patient outcomes, patient complaints, and institutional cost.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The survey was sent to 1,516 directors of pharmacy. There were 193 respondents (response rate 13{\%}) who participated in the survey. Approximately 40{\%} of respondents reported between 1 and 5 adverse events probably or possibly associated with drug shortages at their institution. The majority of respondents reported between 1 and 10 medication errors. The most common types of medication errors reported were omission (n = 86, 55.5{\%}), wrong dose dispensed/administered (n = 85, 54.8{\%}), and wrong drug dispensed/administered (n = 54, 34.8{\%}). The most common outcomes reported by respondents were alternative medication used (n=146, 85.3{\%}), delay of therapy (n = 121, 70.8{\%}), and increased patient monitoring necessary (n = 84, 49.1{\%}). Patient complaints were reported by 38{\%} of respondents. The majority of respondents reported an estimated quarterly institutional cost from shortages of less than {\$}100,000, and approximately one quarter of respondents reported adding at least 1 full-time equivalent to manage drug shortages. The majority of participant comments mentioned the increasing institutional costs attributed to drug shortages.\backslashn\backslashnCONCLUSIONS: Medication errors and adverse events continue to occur from drug shortages, often resulting in inadequate patient care, high institutional costs, and patient complaints. Delayed care and cancelled care have been reported from shortages. Further research is necessary to better classify medication errors and adverse events during a drug shortage.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of prescribing errors identified by pharmacists in hospital inpatients and the factors influencing error identification rates by pharmacists throughout hospital admission. SETTING: 880-bed university teaching hospital in North-west England. METHODS: Data about prescribing errors identified by pharmacists (median: 9 (range 4-17) collecting data per day) when conducting routine work were prospectively recorded on 38 randomly selected days over 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of new medication orders in which an error was identified; predictors of error identification rate, adjusted for workload and seniority of pharmacist, day of week, type of ward or stage of patient admission. RESULTS: 33,012 new medication orders were reviewed for 5,199 patients; 3,455 errors (in 10.5{\%} of orders) were identified for 2,040 patients (39.2{\%}; median 1, range 1-12). Most were problem orders (1,456, 42.1{\%}) or potentially significant errors (1,748, 50.6{\%}); 197 (5.7{\%}) were potentially serious; 1.6{\%} (n = 54) were potentially severe or fatal. Errors were 41{\%} (CI: 28-56{\%}) more likely to be identified at patient's admission than at other times, independent of confounders. Workload was the strongest predictor of error identification rates, with 40{\%} (33-46{\%}) less errors identified on the busiest days than at other times. Errors identified fell by 1.9{\%} (1.5-2.3{\%}) for every additional chart checked, independent of confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists routinely identify errors but increasing workload may reduce identification rates. Where resources are limited, they may be better spent on identifying and addressing errors immediately after admission to hospital.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency, type, and consequences of medication errors in more stages of the medication process, including discharge summaries. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using three methods to detect errors in the medication process: direct observations, unannounced control visits, and chart reviews. With the exception of errors in discharge summaries all potential medication error consequences were evaluated by physicians and pharmacists. SETTING: A randomly selected medical and surgical department at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Eligible in-hospital patients aged 18 or over (n = 64), physicians prescribing drugs and nurses dispensing and administering drugs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency, type, and potential clinical consequences of all detected errors compared with the total number of opportunities for error. RESULTS: We detected a total of 1065 errors in 2467 opportunities for errors (43{\%}). In worst case scenario 20-30{\%} of all evaluated medication errors were assessed as potential adverse drug events. In each stage the frequency of medication errors were-ordering: 167/433 (39{\%}), transcription: 310/558 (56{\%}), dispensing: 22/538 (4{\%}), administration: 166/412 (41{\%}), and finally discharge summaries: 401/526 (76{\%}). The most common types of error throughout the medication process were: lack of drug form, unordered drug, omission of drug/dose, and lack of identity control. CONCLUSION: There is a need for quality improvement, as almost 50{\%} of all errors in doses and prescriptions in the medication process were caused by missing actions. We assume that the number of errors could be reduced by simple changes of existing procedures or by implementing automated technologies in the medication process.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Efforts to restrain pharmaceutical costs in the Norwegian hospital sector have focused on putting pharmaceuticals out to tender with resultant frequent changes in medicine inventories. Due to the extent of physicians failing to prescribe from the hospital drug list, the nurses have to perform generic substitution on the wards. The objective of the present study is to investigate the hospital nurses' experiences with generic substitution and to explore their views on this strategy as a risk factor for medication errors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Personal interviews with 100 nurses who were employed in a large Norwegian hospital were conducted using a semistructured questionnaire.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In all, 75{\%} of nurses thought it was problematic that the hospital's drug inventory was subject to frequent changes, and 91{\%} believed that the high number of generic products may contribute to erroneous dispensing. Nevertheless, three out of four admitted that they seldom or never verified the feasibility of the substitution with the physician, and that it was seldom documented in the medical charts. In total, 42{\%} of the nurses had experienced mistakes that occurred as a result of substitution. They claimed that the medication errors relating to generic substitution derived from difficult drug names, frequent changes in the drug inventory, and the increasing number of generic drugs, as well as from heavy workload and insufficient training.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that generic substitution is often carried out by nurses on the wards. The nurses feel insecure about the situation and report that they do not have the necessary training for the task. They clearly believe that a high number of generic drugs and frequent generic substitutions are risk factors for medication errors. Hence, hospital managers should be aware that such strategies to reduce costs may interfere with patient safety.},
